# aiida-muon
aiida workchain for finding candidate implantation site(s) for the muon and contact hyperfine contribution to the local field. 


To run an example:
edit your pw and pp aiida-qe code in examples/run_example_si_fe_mno.py 

Then:
```
cd example
python run_example_si_fe_mno.py 
```
PS: These examples are Si, Fe and MnO to demonstrate the capabilities of the workchain. FOr the purpose of quick run "loose" calculation parameters have been chosen for a quick 1 processor run.
